Today is not my day
It drives me insane
You have thin skin
They get on my nerves
Actually, I'm currently on my way over to my home
I still get the monday blues
Is everybody on
Must be a bad internet connection
I think he's frozen
I'm not in the mood
I thought he was a lost cause
You're completely helpless
It was kinda pathetic
I don't even want to talk about it
That guy was just clueless
I wanna figure it out on my own
I'll do it myself
I have this under control
You do your thing, and I'll do mine
Can I hold it, all by myself
I'm so pumped
I was so bummed out
He's always so hyper
You're really killing the mood right now
I don't know what you guy are talking about
I just learn recently
We're living cause my sister a party pooper
You're a real killjoy today
It's almost there
It worked
Are you sleepy?
She takes after me
You shouldn't have
I owe you one
The things I do for my future
You're a lifesaver
What would I do without you?
I'm in the middle of improving my English
It means the world to me
You're the best
You scared me
I never knew what I was capable of
What seem to be the trouble?
You're under arrest
What have you done?
There you go
What is your problem
What's wrong with you
Not at all
I find this so cringeworthy
Break it up
He's not worth it
Walk it off
Give it a rest
Don't do this
Don't make things up
That's the cherry on top
Take it down a notch
Do you wanna build a snowman
It's snowing
Hey, you wanna be in a snowball fight with us
Everthing's covered in snow
I just ghosted him
How could he stand me up like this
what happens if i bail
You flake out on me
It's for certain that the show begin tonight
He never showed up
Sorry about the delay
We apologize for any inconvenience
I wanna apologize in advance
I apologize for the inconvenience
I'm sorry to trouble you
No need to panic
You can say that again
Why so glum
Don't get me wrong
That make sence
No offense
Just joking
Don't take it personally
I didn't mean it that way
It's not a big deal
It's not the end of the world
That's all right
I'll be oke
I warned you
Thanks for the heads up
Were you listening to me ?
You better watch out
I told you not to do it
Be sure keep the phone close to you
I gotta go
Who's this
Who's speaking
Please hold
You have reached the voicemail box
Who are you trying to reach ?
There is no one here by that name
I told you we weren't gonna be late
He can be quite a handful
She's super high maintenence
We're unruly
The custumers are demanding
Tough nut to crack
It was a close call
Thanks to me
I'm not doing this to show off
It's not thing to brag about it
That's a given
What did you expect ?
That's the way too obvious
You think I didn't know that ?
Cut it out
Don't cross the line
Knock it off
Quit it
I'll pass
I'm not keen on it
It's not for me
I can't stand it
I wanna sleep on it
Let's me sleep on it
I'll sleep on it and give you my answer
I have been racking to my brains
I was trying to puzzle this out
I gotta put my thinking cap on
Use your head
Ease up there, pal
Rest assured
It will take the weight off your mind
Set your mind at ease
You're in good hand
I need to take it easy
An alley cat
You're a pro at this
