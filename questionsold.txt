Today is not my day
It drives me insane
You have thin skin
They get on my nerves
Actually, I'm currently on my way over to my home
I still get the monday blues
Is everybody on
Must be a bad internet connection
I think he's frozen
I'm not in the mood
I thought he was a lost cause
You're completely helpless
It was kinda pathetic
I don't even want to talk about it
That guy was just clueless
I wanna figure it out on my own
I'll do it myself
I have this under control
You do your thing, and I'll do mine
Can I hold it, all by myself
I'm so pumped
I was so bummed out
He's always so hyper
You're really killing the mood right now
I don't know what you guy are talking about
I just learn recently
We're living cause my sister a party pooper
You're a real killjoy today
It's almost there
It worked
Are you sleepy?
She takes after me
You shouldn't have
I owe you one
The things I do for my future
You're a lifesaver
What would I do without you?
I'm in the middle of improving my English
It means the world to me
You're the best
You scared me
I never knew what I was capable of
What seem to be the trouble?
You're under arrest
What have you done?
There you go
What is your problem
What's wrong with you
Not at all
I find this so cringeworthy
Break it up
He's not worth it
Walk it off
Give it a rest
Don't do this
Don't make things up
That's the cherry on top
Take it down a notch
Do you wanna build a snowman
It's snowing
Hey, you wanna be in a snowball fight with us
Everthing's covered in snow
I just ghosted him
How could he stand me up like this
what happens if i bail
You flake out on me
It's for certain that the show begin tonight
He never showed up
Sorry about the delay
